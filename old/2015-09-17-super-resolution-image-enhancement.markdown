"Zoom In! Enhance!"

Anybody who's seen a TV crime drama is probably familiar with the phrase. With a stern detective looking on, a hipster computer hacker furiously mashes a keyboard and---suddenly---a blurry surveillance video snaps into sharp focus. This cliche is so common it even has a name: the [enhance button](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EnhanceButton){:target="_blank"}. Sophisticated viewers probably assume this is a TV fantasy, yet in some cases this trope has a kernel of truth. 

__Superresolution__ is a class of techniques where a low resolution image is "upscaled" to a higher resolution image. In general this is accomplished by taking a series of low resolution images (each of which are slightly different) and combining them.
