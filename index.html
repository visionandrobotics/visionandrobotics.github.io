		The Vision & Robotics Laboratory, part of Children's National Health System, is engaged in a number of research efforts designed to spur innovation in surgical care. The purpose of the lab is twofold. First, to develop devices that serve an unmet need in the operating room, with the goal of reducing complications and improving outcomes.
		Second, to establish an infrastructure within which scientists, engineers, and clinicians work together in a close feedback loop to rapidly convert ideas into useable tools
